The `jim` command line utility enables running long commands with one word, it's basically __alias but better__

<br>

## Why `jim`? 

- The main focus of `jim` is to let you re-use shell commands that you previously inserted in it. For example:

	```
	$ jim command
	```

	will launch the specified command.

- Another use-case is to launch a command with the `--watch` utility that will time its execution and will let you see it using the `--show` utility. 

	```
	$ jim --watch command
	```

	will launch the specified command *in background* and time it.

In future `jim --sync` will let you share commands between multiple devices.

## New features 

### Shebang 

if a command value starts with something like

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3

...
```

`jim` will launch the command using `python3`
